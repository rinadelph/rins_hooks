# Final Integration Test

Testing the complete Agent-MCP + Claude Code integration:

Current hook configuration:
- agent-registry: Should create .agent/registry.json with session data
- Need to manually verify git-agentmcp functionality

Expected outcomes:
1. Session registration in .agent/registry.json
2. Activity logging for registry updates  
3. Agent-MCP background monitoring (when server runs)
4. Database tracking of Claude Code sessions

This test validates:
- File-based agent detection system
- Universal compatibility (no network dependencies)
- Robust .agent directory integration
- PID and session-based tracking
