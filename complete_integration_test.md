# Complete Integration Test - Dual Hook System

This file tests the integrated functionality of both hooks working together:

## Hooks Active:
1. **agent-registry**: Registers session data in .agent/registry.json
2. **git-agentmcp**: Creates auto-commits with PID tracking

## Expected Behavior:
- Session data recorded in `.agent/registry.json`
- Git commit created with PID and session information
- Agent-MCP monitoring detects session activity (when server running)
- Activity logged in `.agent/session-activity/`

## Test Results:
- ✅ Both hooks installed with same matcher: "Edit|Write|MultiEdit"
- ✅ Hook merger functionality working correctly
- ✅ Fixed installer to merge instead of overwrite hooks
- ✅ Git commits include PID tracking for revert capability
- ✅ Agent-MCP monitoring system ready for background detection

## Integration Components:
- **File-based coordination**: Via .agent directory structure
- **Universal compatibility**: No network dependencies required
- **Multi-agent awareness**: Session and PID tracking
- **Real-time activity**: Both registration and commit logging
- **Background monitoring**: Agent-MCP server integration complete
