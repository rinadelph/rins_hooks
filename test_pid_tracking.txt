PID Tracking Test File

This file is created to test the enhanced auto-commit hook.

Expected behavior:
- Hook should add this specific file to git
- Create a commit with PID tracking information
- Log activity to .agent/session-activity/

Session info should include:
- Session ID from Claude Code
- Current process PID
- Parent process PID (Claude Code main process)
- Timestamp
- Tool name (Write)

Test timestamp: 2025-07-07T07:50:00Z
